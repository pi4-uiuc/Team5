Data: 
-Mike
  I am building a correlation matrix for over between the "Passport Data Completeness Index" and the various variables given below, for each "Accession Number".
Example:
Accession Number: PI 533774
PDCI: 7.8/10
Variables:
  Crude protein percentage
  12-hour in vitro Dry Matter Digestibility
  Absence or presence of Sorghum Yellow Banding Virus
  Starch percentage
  Average Seedling vigor 
  Net Energy for lactation (cattle) epxressed in Mcal/cwt
  Aluminum toxicity tolerance
